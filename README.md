** Project Status **
This project is not under active development or maintenance. There's almost certainly better architectural approaches that have been developed in the intervening years since initial creation. This project is left online for educational purposes only.

Card recognition and organization based on [opencv](http://opencv.org/)

[demo video](http://youtu.be/ppNy9fdw91E)

This is a set of utilities to recognize and extract card images from a video feed, and then recognize those images against a known database.

**Dependencies and Setup**

python 2.7, numpy, Flask, SQLAlchemy, Elixir
<pre>
sudo apt-get install python-dev
sudo pip install -r requirements.txt
</pre>
[OpenCV](http://opencv.org/) 2.3.1-7
<pre>sudo apt-get install python-opencv</pre>

* MTG Set Card Images ([GathererDownloader Instructions](https://github.com/chrismeyersfsu/card_scan/wiki/Gatherer-Downloader))
* webcam
* white printer paper

**Configure**

<a href="config.py">config.py</a>

<code>db_file="inventory.sqlite3"</code>

<code>cards_file="cards.xml"</code> card listing obtained from [GathererDownloader](https://github.com/chrismeyersfsu/card_scan/wiki/Gatherer-Downloader)

<code>basic_magic_set_dir="cards/"</code> card images obtained from [GathererDownloader](https://github.com/chrismeyersfsu/card_scan/wiki/Gatherer-Downloader)

**Running**

***1. Scan***
<pre>python -m utils.run_scan</pre>
<br />

<center>

| Key                  | Function     |
|:--------------------:|--------------|
| <i>middle mouse wheel</i> | delete scan  |
| <i>space</i>              | rescan image |
| <i>r</i>                  | rescan background |
| <i>escape</i>             | finish scanning |

</center>
<br />

***2. Match***

Requires an image set to match against ([GathererDownloader Instructions](https://github.com/chrismeyersfsu/card_scan/wiki/Gatherer-Downloader))
<pre>python -m utils.run_match</pre>

***3. Verify***

Verification allows you to manually label any cards the matching process could not recognize, or was uncertain about whether its recognition was correct.
<pre>python website.py</pre>

**Scanning Notes**

It also helps to have lighting coming from both sides, to reduce the effect of slightly curved cards throwing shadows that alter their rectangular shape in the camera's view.
