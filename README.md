Card recognition and organization based on [opencv](opencv.willowgarage.com)

[demo video](http://youtu.be/ppNy9fdw91E)

This is a set of utilities to recognize and extract card images from a video feed, and then recognize those images against a known database.

**Dependencies and Setup**

python 2.7, numpy, Flask, SQLAlchemy, Elixir
<pre>
sudo apt-get install python-dev
sudo pip install -r requirements.txt
</pre>
[OpenCV](opencv.willowgarage.com) 2.3.1-7
<pre>sudo apt-get install python-opencv</pre>

* MTG Set Card Images
* webcam
* white printer paper

**Running**

***1. Scan***
<pre>python -m utils.run_scan</pre>
<br />

<center>

| Key                  | Function     |
|:--------------------:|--------------|
| <i>middle mouse wheel</i> | delete scan  |
| <i>space</i>              | rescan image |
| <i>r</i>                  | rescan background |
| <i>escape</i>             | finish scanning |

</center>
<br />

***2. Match***

<i>Requires an image set to match against (see wiki)</i>
<pre>python -m utils.run_match</pre>

***3. Verify***

Verification allows you to manually edit any dependencies introduced in the matching process.
<pre>python website.py</pre>

**Scanning Notes**

It also helps to have lighting coming from both sides, to reduce the effect of slightly curved cards throwing shadows that alter their rectangular shape in the camera's view.
